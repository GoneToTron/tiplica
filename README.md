# tiplica

<h2> Project Tiplica</h2>
  <p>This is my first coding project. It's supposed to help my kids learn their multiplication tables, and in the future, other math topics as well.</p>
  <p>It's in Polish, but ready to translate to any language. My idea is to make it as simple as possible.
  <p>You are most welcome to comment and help.</p>
